<p>
VAS (Visibility Assistance System) is created to provide an Aid to drivers driving through impaired visibility conditions. Driving a closed vehicle becomes a tedious and a dangerous task while the environmental conditions are not favourable. In such conditions the driver needs assistance in terms of visibility data. But who is gonna calculate that data? That's where VAS comes in. VAS calculates relevant visibility data and feeds that information directly to the driver and it itselef suggests the driver what is the safest practise to follow in such conditions.
